Some sounds in this free (as in free beer) OpenSpades 2016.01.XX release are from other programs.
I am terribly sorry for not asking for permissions and whatnot, though I believe all games should be compatible with GPL license.
Credits:
Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory 2.06b
Urban Terror 4.2
Infiltration 2.9 CE

These games are lovable and have respectable developers. If there is something you have to tell the author, go to buildandshoot.com and find "Chameleon". He will then contact the unknown author of this release himself.
I am not giving out email for my own reasons.

OpenSpades originally was released under GPL v2 (or v3, whichever is the latest) license.
The author of this release should have released source code together with binaries, but given poor condition of the community, releasing source code would furhter increase amount of available hacks in the future.
Source code is planned to be released in the future. Before that, more serious fixes will be commited to official OS GitHub.
